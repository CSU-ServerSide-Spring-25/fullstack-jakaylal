## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version X.X.X)
- npm (version X.X.X)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd my-node-react-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies on root folder:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Start the app server and client:

   ```
   npm run start
   ```

### Usage

- The server will be running on `http://localhost:9000` (or the port specified in your server configuration).
- The React client will be running on `http://localhost:9010`.

You can access the application in your web browser at the client URL. The client will communicate with the server to fetch and display data as needed.
